<p>Siemens Airlink provides secure and reliable wireless connectivity between railway rolling stock and wayside equipment. Airlink is used as a communication platform by light rail and metropolitan train systems worldwide, carrying millions of passengers every day.</p>
<p>When I joined the Airlink software department, the job was characterized by month long test sprints, interrupted only by brief periods of development. In an effort to change this unsustainable test/development balance, I spearheaded the development of a fully automated test solution.</p>
<p>Utilizing a custom software-defined networking solution based on Click, the system allows on-the-fly reconfiguration of test setups and dynamic allocation of physical and virtual hardware to a given test run.</p>
<p>The test framework enables automatic test cases to be written in Python, accessing and querying units under test through a compact, high-level notation. The framework also provided automatic parameterization of test cases, allowing fine-grained targeting or restriction of tests. Using Python's introspection features, comments can also be automatically extracted to create textual descriptions of test cases for review by the product owner.</p>

<h2>Continuous integration system for Siemens Airlink</h2>

</table>
<p>In 2014, the Airlink team started a continuous integration project, aiming
to achieve improved developer output through better tooling and a reduction in
build errors and down time.</p>
<p>Thus began a slow, at times painful, but also much-overdue transition from a
legacy nightly build system (based on Subversion plus endless amounts of ad-hoc
shell scripts), towards a comprehensive continuous integration system (based on
Git, GitLab and Buildbot).</p>
<p>Together with a coworker, I oversaw the transition to Git including rollout
of the new infrastructure, the authoring of team guidelines and documentation,
and the design and implementation of the new CI workflow.</p>

<h2>DSE sales site</h2>

<p>In 2009 I was tasked with completing the customer-facing sales site for DSE, when an external contractor failed to meet a critical deadline. The initial prototype was written (in PHP), tested and deployed over the course of a weekend, just in time for the DSE 2009 opening sale in which 26 companies placed orders amounting to DKK 1,059,500 during the first three hours. It worked flawlessly throughout the financial year.</p>
<p>In 2011 I rebuilt the system from scratch, this time in Python, improving the software design and adding a multitude of features, including a much requested "cinema seat-selector" style system for booking stands for the DSE Fair.</p>

<p><a href="http://usedbooks.dk">Usedbooks.dk</a> is an online marketplace for textbooks and accessories, aimed at DTU students and run by DTU students.</p>
<p>When the previous owners were seeking someone to take over the site, I applied on behalf of the Software and Mathematics Council at DTU,
and single-handedly rewrote the website codebase to enhance usability, functionality and stability.</p>
<p>Usedbooks.dk interfaces with <a href="http://www.polyteknisk.dk">Polyteknisk Boghandel</a> and Amazon.com
(through the <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html">Amazon Product Advertising API</a>)
to retrieve book details, covers and prices (for comparison with the usedbooks.dk prices).</p>
<h2>Infrastructure supervisor at DSE Fair Lyngby 2009–2013</h2>

<p>Organized by the volunteer-run <a href="http://www.studerende.dk/">Students Business Relations</a> (De Studerendes Erhvervskontakt, DSE), DSE Fair Lyngby is the largest job fair in Denmark.</p>
<p>I was ultimately responsible for all electricity, network and radio communications during the 2009 DSE Fair Lyngby,
which saw more than 150 participating companies and organizations and more than 7.000 visitors, a role I reprised the following four years.</p>
<p>In addition to custom development work for the many IT services at the fair, I worked with fellow DSE volunteers and external partners
(DTU IT Service and DTU Campus Service) to achieve a smooth experience for both exhibitors and visitors at the fair.</p>
<h2>MiniUML extensible diagram editor</h2>

</table>
<p>In 2008, I developed the MiniUML diagram editor together with two fellow
students; essentially a showcase of what can be achieved using WPF, XAML and
data bindings.</p>
<p>All diagram shapes were provided by separate plugin assemblies, as were the visual look-and-feel of the application. Adding new shapes or providing another color theme is just a matter of dropping a new DLL-file in the program folder.</p>
<p>The program, which is open source, has been downloaded from <a href="http://miniuml.codeplex.com/" title="MiniUML at CodePlex">CodePlex</a> more than 7,000 times.</p>
<h2>Open Source contributions</h2>
<p>While closed-source software makes up the vast majority of my development work over the years, I have made contributions to <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/">MediaWiki</a> and <a href="http://www.read.cs.ucla.edu/click/">Click</a> among other projects.</p>
<p>My open-source claim to fame, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/kwi/urllinker">UrlLinker</a>, was written to answer a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1188129/replace-urls-in-text-with-html-links/">Stackoverflow.com question</a>, and since made its way into <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla!</a>. Ironically, I actually wrote this after having stopped using PHP for new projects; hence I've never used the code myself. It appears to be quite popular in its own little niche, though.</p>
<p>While my Python packages <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/WsgiUnproxy/">WsgiUnproxy</a> and <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py2-ipaddress/">py2-ipaddress</a> do not represent many lines of new code, they also consistently see some 3,000 downloads a month.</p></div></body>
