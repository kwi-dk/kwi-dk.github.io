<p>Since several people have mentioned not understanding the ending
of "Shade", here's my take on it.</p>
<p>First of all, note that "Shade" has three meanings in this game:
the windowshade in the apartment, shade in the abstract as relief
from sunlight, and a shade in the sense of a spirit of the
dead.</p>
<p>That last meaning is quite telling. At first, I thought that
the PC was delirious from exposure to the desert sun. On
reflection, I think the PC is already dead before the game
begins.</p>
<p>Consider the windowshade for a moment. As the title implies,
it's a very important furnishing. Opening it and seeing the desert
outside is the climax of the first part of the game. The
windowshade is thus the thing that conceals the truth. (By
contrast, the mirror restores the illusion, as is consistent with
its use by conjurors and the like. But once the truth is known,
illusions cannot last long. But I digress.) Now remember the
response when you try to open the windowshade before the proper
time: "You have no desire to look night in the face". You don't
want to face death, so you've constructed this "shade" that
conceals the truth. (The taxi, in turn, seems to me a
Charon-substitute, come to carry you to your final destination.
That's why the PC fears it so when it finally arrives.)</p>
<p>Now consider the news reports. Three people went missing. You're
one of them. You encounter one other in the ending. Or is it that
simple? The tiny figure's comment suggests that the three of you
swap roles every so often, as part of the game you play with each
other.</p>
<p>I'd like to make the loopy suggestion that, in fact, you swap roles
at least once over the course of the game. You look at the mirror
and see the room in its pristine state. Everything is then
restored, because you've <i>traded places with the person on the
other side of the mirror</i>. That's why that world is a very shallow
one, which you can't affect in any way. It's just a reflection of
what you were in before. Sitting on the futon, you pass through
another layer of mirror/mirage, this time reversing the roles of
tormentor and victim. The only thing that makes me think this isn't
another swap of roles is the fact that you see the tiny figure
running for cover <i>before</i> the final transformation.</p>
<p>But then, it probably doesn't pay to try to make the game make
too much sense. The work is a lot like <i>Ubik</i> in that way, or the
brainwashing scene from "The Manchurian Candidate". It's clear that
nothing you see is completely real.</p>
<p>On a slightly silly note, consider the statement that "a little
shade trails behind [the dunes]". Well, if all three of you are
dead already, that's exactly what you encounter. A little shade.
Like the little drunk in the samble transcript for "Guess the
Verb".</p>

<p>And here's mine &ndash; though note that I arrived at it through
extensive ifMUD discussion with J. Robinson Wheeler (Rob) and Dan
Shiovitz (inky).</p>
<div class="msgquote"><p>That last meaning is quite telling. At first,

sun. On reflection, I think the PC is already dead before the game

<p>Personally, I buy the first one. The PC is delirious and dying,
but also in the process of becoming one with the desert. Hence the
references to switching places &ndash; not with some other, also lost
person, but with the mechanism of his own death. This is borne out
by messages earlier in the game, to the effect that you want to
become one with the desert, and that if you stay in your apartment
you will start to meld with its beige blahness. Moreover, the book
turns into the Desert Elemental's Handbook by the end, so
presumably that is what you now are. The desert itself, able to
view your puny self from the outside. And, paradoxically, also
merged with the furnishings, or the furnishings with you, or...
something. It's all sand in the end.</p>
<p>Some have suggested that the game begins in darkness because you
start out before dawn and work towards noon, when all shade is
gone. I think that's perhaps wrong, and that there's a more general
inversion at work: that the things you consciously fear are the
reflections of what you ought to fear. Darkness, when the danger is
day. Confinement, when the danger is the lack of protection. Being
caught (note the hasty paranoid scribble re. the taxi), when the
danger is not being found.</p>
<p>Buried inside all of that is the text adventure you're playing
on your computer. When I saw that I was annoyed; I mean, such an
old sad tired trope, right? Even the thing about being an IF
author: I mean, on the one hand, yes, it's meta-clever, as Rob
points out. But on the other hand, it's meta-clever that doesn't
necessarily go anywhere, AND it's already been done &ndash; in Calliope.
In fact, I'd JUST seen a badly- implented text adventure game
running in Clock, so I was feeling less than charitable and if the
writing hadn't been, otherwise, so damn good, that might've tipped
me over the edge into quitting.</p>
<p>And why, for the love of Peter, if you're going to make a Cadre
reference, have it be to a text adventure of his <i>book</i>? Why not
either, a) one of the real text adventures he has really written,
or some pastiche thereof; or, b) something lighter, like an
IF-ication of the Eye of Argon MSTing? I guess my feeling was, when
I was first reading this, that the author had hit some slightly off
tone. <i>Ready, Okay!</i> is not the kind of thing that would lend
itself to IF.</p>
<p>Well, right. But it's zarf. I didn't really piece this part all
the way together until after I found that out.<br />
<br />
[Sidenote: does a game written by a known-to-be-cryptic author,
because people search it more deeply, actually bear more meaning
than others? Take that well-known Borges story and reframe it like
this: Pierre Menard writes a book, and it's dreck, but then,
weirdly, there turns up an authenticated manuscript by Cervantes,
and it's the exact same damn thing word for word; and because it
says By Cervantes, it's studied until it yields fruit...<br />
<br />
Eeagh, too much grad school. No offense, Zarf. This stuff wouldn't
have been dreck regardless of author. Now, back to our regularly
scheduled program.]</p>
<p>What follows spoils <i>Ready, Okay!</i> as well as Shade, so more
space is needed, I suppose.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There.</p>
<p>The game, when you look at it, tells you not only that it's
Cadre's <i>Ready, Okay</i>, but also that you keep dying of lack of
insulin. Well, er, hunh? Kind of an odd hunger-type timing puzzle,
except that obviously the point of it is to identify, for those who
have read RO, which character your PC is. Namely, Molly, the
narrator's 12-year-old sister.</p>
<p>An interesting choice in several ways. Molly is a nudist:
probably a natural for the OM setting. She's also deathly afraid of
water, at least any water that doesn't come from household piping
&ndash;so much so that she's always calling the narrator to bring her
rain gear for her at the slightest hint of drizzle. The touch of
water brings her grief, and the prophetic knowledge of death.<br />
<br />
She's also doomed. The reader of RO! knows, generally, that a lot
of people are going to die, from the very first sentence. But he
doesn't know, necessarily (though it seems plausible), that Molly
has to be one of them; in fact there's a bit where she's in danger
and seems possibly to be about to escape it. The most hideous
moment of reading the book, for me, was the moment when I realized
that she wasn't going to make it after all. Eccentric though she
is, she's a source of much of the book's sweetness: expansively
loving, beautiful, open. And the only, very far from sufficient,
consolation, is that her brother reaches her before she dies, and
that she is not alone.<br />
<br />
So what would the game of that be like? Just as Zarf has it, I
suppose: unwinnable. And any player with half a clue ought to KNOW
it's going to be unwinnable, because the foreshadowing has been
there from the beginning, from sentence one; in IF it would
probably be in the ABOUT file. Forget the insulin: whether or not
you die of diabetes is irrelevant because the whole universe is
arrayed against you. You are inside the plot, inescapably, and it's
one where you die.<br />
<br />
The only way to win, says the text of Shade about the RO! game, is
not to play.</p>
<p>The only way to survive Shade...</p>
<p>Right. (Lucian Smith's review remarks on this. The PC should
just stay put and for heaven's sake NOT TOUCH ANYTHING.)</p>
<p>But you do <i>win</i> &ndash; by transposition of places. And then the
little figure says "my turn." What does that mean? That it's Zarf's
turn to play one of your games? That the PC's rational mind is
taking over again for the actual final moment of death? That the
battle with the desert is to begin all over again, time-looped
hideously in some kind of moebius reality? I've heard various
theories.<br />
<br />
So what? Well, a couple of things occur to me, I guess. One is that
it's possible that all that stuff I mined out of the <i>Ready, Okay</i>
reference doesn't really go too deep, and that Zarf just happened
to have read RO! recently and felt like tipping his hat (does he
wear one? mental note to replay BAP) to Adam. But I don't like that
theory. In fact, I'm going to assert my right as reader to
partially determine the significance of the text. It goes deeper
because I saw depth, nyah. The inner game is a half-mirror of the
outer; the doomed Molly like the doomed PC, but given a half-twist
because her fears and her eventual fate are different. And the PC's
is, in a way, worse, because alone. There's a comment there too. If
you win, you win alone.<br />
<br />
The game draws our attention (in itself, in its nature) to this
interesting question: why does the audience stick with a story when
the ending we want is guaranteed never to come? Why are we playing?
Why read RO! to its screeching conclusion, like observing an
inevitable car cr&ndash;</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Well, it's a problem that comes up again and again with the
Cadre oeuvre, isn't it? Count the happy endings, my friends. I
count: 1. And it was in the game I liked least of his works, and
could take least seriously. If you take a Cadre sort of plot and
subtract out the wacky characters and vicious humor and substitute
for this the haunting loneliness of the zarfian vision, Shade is
what you get. Tragedy, warning signs, inevitability, tightly locked
together. A concern with the reliability of the narrator and the
narrator's perception (though that comes up in another zarfian
context as well.)<br />
<br />
So there's that. But there's also the curious identity of the PC:
IF player, would-be IF-author. BAP plays with identity by
contortion and multiplicity: you become many people. Shade plays
with it by dissolution: you become no one. You lose track of what
is inside yourself and what is outside. Player or author. Dreamer
or dream. The PC becomes the desert that destroys him; the player
is coopted into being the driving force of the game that defeats
him.<br />
<br />
Notice how gleeful you get, at the end, tearing stuff down,
crumbling it up. I thought this was pretty clever on the part of
the game, because just as the text describes, I'd gone manic at
this part. As a player, you're forced to shift your goal partway
through the game. You stop trying to stop the sand flood and start
provoking it, not because you hope to survive, but because the plot
demands it, because it's the only action you can take that has any
meaning, and because in some strange way it feels defiant and
grants a blessed relief.<br />
<br />
See? You, the player, are now playing for the universe, not for the
PC. You're advancing the dark cause. You're killing your poor
little avatar. Knowingly. You've ceased to be the man and become
the desert.</p>

</div>
<p>This is after you look in the mirror. The description changes to
"Not much of an apartment, no. ..." and describes things in such a
way as to suggest nothing's happened. Instead of the room being
"nearly barren now; walls and ceiling are blank", it has "one desk
... dusty computer ... your futon. Second-hand stereo ... A kitchen
nook one way and a bathroom nook the other." The plant even reverts
to a hyacinth (let's see, I've seen hyacinth, spider plant, palm,
and cactus&ndash;anything else?).<br />
<br />
Yet something is still amiss. Whenever you try to look at
something, you get back "You can't quite make out anything
unusual."<br />
<br />
Whenever you try to open or close or touch something, or sit down,
or do <i>anything</i>, you get back messages about how you're getting
dizzy, how you need to sit down. In fact, I <i>did</i> try to sit
down:<br />
<br />
<tt>&gt; sit<br />
(on top of the futon) You reach out and touch your hand to the
futon. It feels like glass.<br />
<br />
The reflection shimmers like water, but the mirror is only heat &ndash;
pooling among the dunes, rising from the sands.</tt><br />
<br />
... which sort of assumes you tried to touch the mirror earlier,
since the description <i>then</i> is much the same:<br />
<br />
<tt>&gt; touch mirror<br />
You reach out and touch your hand to itself. It feels like
glass.</tt></p>
<p>Are you really getting anywhere, or are you going around in
circles? Mr Plotkin seems to have taken the concept of a one-room
game to its logical conclusion: not only does the game contrive to
keep you from moving anywhere, the very situation prevents you. No
matter what you do, you still can't make a change.</p>
<p>No wonder people have been saying they were weirded out by
it.</p>
