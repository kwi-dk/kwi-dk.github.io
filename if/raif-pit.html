<p>* Likely To Be Eaten By A Bottomless Pit</p>
<p>I was in DC last week, and in the course of bumming around, I
went to a new Imax movie about caves. &lt;<a href=
"http://www.amazingcaves.com/">http://www.amazingcaves.com/</a>&gt;</p>
<p>Caves are the original IF setting; caves are also darn cool.
I've written an IF game set in a cave (<i>Hunter, in Darkness</i>).
But I didn't actually have much idea what caves were like, when I
wrote it. Most of my description was second-hand Crowther and
Woods. So, hey, I thought, I should see good movie footage of real
caves.</p>
<p>(It was either that or <i>Michael Jordan To The Max</i>. Not a
hard choice actually.)</p>
<p>The movie was filmed in three caves: a "traditional" limestone
cave in Arizona, an ice cave in a glacier in Greenland, and an
underwater cave in the Yucatan. The actual purpose of the
expeditions was microbiological research &ndash; taking samples of water
from strange and isolated environments, hoping to discover peculiar
organisms.<br />
But let me talk about cave environments.</p>
<p>Limestone caves are the ones everyone thinks of. Stalagmites,
stalactites, flowstone. Bats and blind fish. You can find a million
pictures.</p>
<p>...Remember that the pictures are illuminated by professional
photographers with floodlights. The natural state of a cave is
sightless, and don't you forget it &ndash; I don't want to hear about
glowing moss, either. (Mosses and lichens are photosynthetic; they
<i>require</i> light to grow, they don't produce it. If you want to
introduce a magical ecology, that's another matter, and a more
complicated one.)</p>
<p>And caves aren't flat, either. "Twisty passages" and "chasms"
and "bottomless pits" are <i>accurate</i> cliches. (Okay, maybe not
bottomless.)<br />
The same goes for "low crawls" and "tight squeezes" &ndash; the ceiling
height wasn't designed for human convenience. Caving is a scramble,
not a stroll.</p>
<p>Then there's the ice cave. The one in the movie was basically a
vertical crack in a glacier, 500 feet deep. Descent was by
rappelling straight down on ropes &ndash; there didn't seem to be
anywhere to stand.<br />
Not even at the bottom; that was a pool of liquid water, who knows
how deep.</p>
<p>The difference between ice and stone is that ice is nearly
molten, if you see what I mean. A glacier flows detectably over the
course of a year; the interior is constantly under strain. And the
farther down you go, the greater the stress. "Boulder-size chunks
of ice blowing out of the wall with no warning," was a line from
the movie. (Not an event they caught on film, I'm sorry to
say.)</p>
<p>If it's warm outdoors &ndash; warm enough for ice to get shiny in
direct sunlight &ndash; that means water flowing down through the
glacier. The explorers in the movie had to wait for four cold days
in a row before they could safely descend. Otherwise, well, it's
rappelling down a vertical ice sheet with a hypothermic waterfall
blasting down on your head. Good luck.</p>
<p>The underwater cave was by far the weirdest, visually. First of
all, only suicidal lunatics go scuba-diving in caves. (Also my
boss. No, wait, ...) Cave-diving is just like normal scuba-diving,
except it's pitch black and they took the surface away.
Alternatively: it's just like normal spelunking, except that if you
get lost, you die. Doesn't this sound like fun?</p>
<p>Descriptive notes: you can tell where you've been, because you
know those bubbles that constantly rise from scuba masks? They hit
the ceiling and <i>stick</i> there. But you can also tell where you've
been because you unreel a rope as you go. So you can follow it out.
Be sure to attach plastic arrows to the rope, pointing out. You
don't want to mistake the direction.</p>
<p>Swimming stirs up silt, and the water in the cave can turn
totally opaque awfully fast. Turning around in a dead end stirs up
silt even faster. Don't lose the rope.</p>
<p>But the strangest thing down there was a halocline &ndash; a flat,
stable boundary between seawater and fresh water. This occurred in
a place where an underground river was flowing towards the sea.
Seawater had backed up into the cave, and the less-dense fresh
water flowed smoothly above it for a distance. You could <i>see</i> the
boundary. It looked like... the surface of a lake. Except that
people were swimming above it. And then they swam down through it.
The surface rippled.</p>
<p>You can do this at home, actually. Fill a glass with very salty
water; fill another with fresh water. Put a piece of cardboard or
plastic across the fresh glass and turn it upside down. Put it
above the brine glass. Pull the cardboard out. The halocline will
remain. You can slosh the salt water back and forth, if you're
careful.</p>
<p>Do this over a sink.</p>
<p>My perhaps-not-lunatic boss says that you can get a similar
visible interface (though not so distinct) at a thermocline, where
warm water overlies colder water. Or at a geologically active
sea-floor site, where hydrogen sulfide is dissolved in water, again
making it denser. (And poisonous. Even to skin contact. Don't stay
down there long.)</p>
<p>But enough about cave movies. Two days later I had even more
free time, so I drove two hours west, to the tourist cave zone of
Virginia.</p>
<p>Now I freely admit that these are wussified caves, with electric
lighting, levelled floors, and handrails. But you can definitely
get an idea of how caves run. If you leave early from DC, you can
take three hour-long cave tours in a day. This I did. I took notes,
too.</p>
<p>* Endless Caves:</p>
<p>Very rusty, dull. (That is, the cave walls were brown-red
flowstone, colored by iron oxide, and not the sparkling white of
pure calcite.)</p>
<p>A few patches of snow-white flowstone, however. Also places
where bluish limestone was exposed &ndash; a strong contrast to the
general redness.</p>
<p>The cave was quite dry; there hadn't been much rain the past
season, so water levels were low, and some reflecting pools were
entirely dry.</p>
<p>A barrel had been set in place below a drip, to catch the water
and divert it off the walkway. I believe that was around the
1920's.<br />
At this point, the barrel is starting to be crusted with limestone,
especially around the rim. Gives you an idea how fast the stuff
grows.</p>
<p>Shield formations: a roundish horizontal plate sticking straight
out from the wall. (Horizontal, or somewhat tilted.) Very
strange-looking. They usually have stalactites dripping down to the
floor, which support the stone, but in fact a shield grows out from
the wall; the stalactites come along later. Water seeps out of a
crack, and leaves thin stone lips on the crack's two edges.<br />
Now it's seeping out between the lips. So they grow, straight out.
The result is a double plate. Capillary action draws the water out
between the plates, so it keeps growing. If it's unsupported, it
can break, of course &ndash; possibly the plates will separate, leaving
a strange tree-ring-like texture on the exposed surfaces.</p>
<p>Pillars and columns with inch-wide gaps in them. If the bottom
of the cave is mud, it can settle under the weight of flowstone
formations. Pillars crack and separate. The walls of that cave had
a horizontal crack running around them, where they'd separated as
well.</p>
<p>Three levels to the cave. Stream eats down, irregularly, leaving
different levels and chasms between them.</p>
<p>Rimstone: "worm" effect as water flows over a wide, flat, gentle
slope. Calcite builds up on irregularities, forming a network of
basin-lips.</p>
<p>Calcite rims and shelves where water pooled. (Minerals building
up at the waterline.) Lilypad formations inside dried-up pools.</p>
<p>Slab rooms where the roof has fallen down, splitting stone
flatly. (This is where the cave walls or ceiling look like rough
rock, instead of flowstone fanciness.)</p>
<p>A wide, very low room with many fine stal/pillars. This was the
area that's a reflecting pool in times of greater water
seepage.<br />
"Very low" means only a foot or two high; but as wide as any
chamber in the cave.</p>
<p>Plant roots go surprisingly deep into the ground. Where clay was
visible in the cave, sometimes it had little root-tendrils
threading through it.</p>
<p>Lots of bats. Clinging to walls, ceilings &ndash; not huge cinematic
clouds of bats, but they were frequent. Very active in the spring.
They only nest in caves; they go outdoors to feed. These bats
seemed to be fairly used to people; they would fly within three
feet of you.</p>
<p>The sound of bats screwing is sort of a sharp clicking
chitter.</p>
<p>Moss growing in the cave &ndash; ha! &ndash; only where the electric
lights are set. Really, a small patch of moss where each light is
shining on the wall. Nowhere else. On the other hand, candles and
oil lamps leave soot stains on the wall (after a time), so what are
you going to do?</p>
<p>The cave system has not been entirely mapped; it goes at least
five miles, and new sections are still being discovered. (Most of
that isn't on the tour, of course.)</p>
<p>* Shenandoah Caverns:</p>
<p>Gravel floor (laid down by humans, not natural) &ndash; but it has
developed a film of wet clay. Very slippery. I fell down ten feet
from the entrance, and spent the rest of the tour with clay all
over my hands.</p>
<p>As in Endless, the walls are rusty-reddish.</p>
<p>White flowstone formations studded with large flat calcite
crystals. "Spangles" up to an inch wide. Very nice.</p>
<p>Three levels. The cave has been entirely explored, at least as
far as people can pass at all.</p>
<p>Spot where two underground rivers joined &ndash; turbulence caused
deep "whirlpool" weathering in the walls and ceiling. Swirls and
round depressions &ndash; looked like a tidal sinkhole, not a cave wall.
The weathering extended quite a ways down the passage, as the
current was swift for some distance.</p>
<p>Large blocks fallen, forming flat-surface caves, long after the
river-passage formed. (Possibly fell during an earthquake.) Now
flowstone is covering up the broken surfaces.</p>
<p>A very large, tall wall of flowstone formations.</p>
<p>* Skyline Caverns:</p>
<p>Not much flowstone.</p>
<p>Three levels, but the lowest is entirely submerged. (It has not
been explored, as the entrances are too narrow for divers.) Three
different streams flow through the cave, one falling down a
thirty-foot waterfall.</p>
<p>The stream level varies with weather &ndash; surface water seeping
down. When I was there, one stream was nearly dry.</p>
<p>Seepage pools: not fed by a stream or watercourse. The water
enters only through seepage from walls and ceiling. Form shallow
reflecting pools.</p>
<p>Original exit is still visible, a narrow vertical shaft.</p>
<p>Anthodites: calcite needles in small sprays on the walls and
ceiling. Look like sea urchins. A wide range of sizes.</p>
<p>These formed in small air pockets above a passage that had
filled in with mud. (The air in the pockets was sealed off from the
outside atmosphere.) When the cave was dug out and the anthodites
exposed, they stopped growing.</p>
<p>* Conclusion</p>
<p>Observation is good. If you want to write about caves, go look
in one.<br />
If you're actually an adventurer, and not a wimp like me, go
caving.<br />
Report back. We're curious what it's like beyond the handrails.</p>

<p>The Mammoth Cave National Park tour guides always turn out the
lights on you at some point during the tour.&nbsp; (They warn you
first.)&nbsp; The first time, it takes at least thirty very
long-seeming seconds, maybe longer, before you get used to the idea
that your eyes will NOT adjust.&nbsp; Then after another minute or
so it sinks in that if the tour guide doesn't turn on the lights,
you will die before you find your way to the exit.&nbsp; (This is
an especially effective thought when the exit is a mere hundred
yards away, although on the Historical Tour it's much further than
that.)</p>
<p>BTW, the caves you described seemed fairly heavy on the
limestone formations.&nbsp; If you ever get the chance, go on one
of the tours of the caves under the sandstone cap, such as the
Historical Cave Tour that the park service conducts.&nbsp; With no
flowing limestone to cover things up, you can better see the
patterns the water carves in the rock, and it's fascinating.&nbsp;
Big scallops, little scallops, and all sorts of other oddities.</p>
<p>Also, parts of the Mammoth Caves are a lot more vertical than
most of what you described.&nbsp; Sure, you may walk on what seems
like a level floor, but after a few minutes of meandering you can
look up a shaft and see where you were.&nbsp; (You can't tell by
looking, of course, but the guide may point it out.)&nbsp; Climbing
the many stairs at the end of the Historical Tour will wear you
out, and it will really bring home exactly how nonlevel the floor
was during your apparently-level descent.</p>

<p>This is true. Adventure gets this right, but lots of underground
games only go up and down at well-defined stairs or pits. People
are thinking of buildings or dungeons when they write these
things.<br />
Still, Kentucky caves are awfully horizontal. In much of the rest
of the world, caving is about big pits, which is why it's called
"potholing" in England. (The second longest cave in the world,
Hoelloch in Switzerland, is very much like Flint Ridge turned at a
forty-five-degree vertical angle.)<br />
Vertical caving is tricky &ndash; like mountain-climbing underground &ndash;
but it doesn't lend itself to great wandering explorations.<br />
I wonder if Adventure would have been invented anywhere else but in
the land of horizontal caving?</p>

Crowther and Woods. So, hey, I thought, I should see good movie
footage of real caves.</p></div>
<p>Caves and caving.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, one of my favorite books was <i>The Longest
Cave</i>, by Roger Brucker and Richard Watson.&nbsp; This is the
story of the exploration of the Flint Ridge and Mammoth Cave
systems, and how they were linked together to form the longest cave
in the world. It's full of exciting adventure and rich description
of cave rooms, passages, and formations.&nbsp; (If you like
adventure stories and you like Adventure, I think you'd like
reading this book at least half as much as I did.)&nbsp; In my
boring suburban bedroom, I dreamed of caving in Flint Ridge.</p>
<p>When I first read the transcripts for a game of Adventure (the
original one), before I ever got to play it, I found them extremely
exciting.&nbsp; I couldn't put my finger on why it was the earlier
parts of the game that affected me even more than the later fantasy
ones.<br />
The reason is that Will Crowther, the author of the first half of
Adventure, was the same Will Crowther whose exploits are described
in <i>The Longest Cave</i> &ndash; and the descriptions he writes for
rooms are the same kind you read about in real-life caving
adventure.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp; You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet
high.&nbsp; The walls are frozen rivers of orange stone.&nbsp; An
awkward canyon and a good passage exit from East and West sides of
the chamber.</p>

<p>&nbsp; You are in a jumble of rock, with cracks everywhere.</p>

<p>&nbsp; You are at a wide place in a very tight N/S canyon.</p>

<p>&nbsp; You are at a complex junction.&nbsp; A low hands and
knees passage from the north joins a higher crawl from the east to
make a walking passage going west.&nbsp; There is also a large room
above.&nbsp; The air is damp here.<br /></p>

</blockquote>
<p>That stuff is realistic.</p>
<p>No other game captures this feeling.&nbsp; Even the Don Woods
parts of Adventure don't do it; they feel like Tolkien, not
spelunking.<br />
I don't think Don Woods was a caver.&nbsp; (I suppose I could ask
him, as he is still active on the net.&nbsp; I don't know what
became of Crowther;<br />
his name is all over the early Internet RFCs but he's nowhere to be
seen nowadays.)&nbsp; Many of the features decried by later gamers
&ndash; most notably, the passages that don't run straight, so you can't
go south and then get back by going north &ndash; make sense in Flint
Ridge caves.&nbsp; (Typing "S" from an Adventure room doesn't mean
"take me to the room South of here"; it means "take the passage
leaving from the South wall of this room, follow its twists and
turns until I emerge in another room somewhere.")</p>
<div class="msgquote">

in one. If you're actually an adventurer, and not a wimp like me,

</div>
<p>It would be nice to see a cave-crawl that is actually a
cave-crawl.<br />
In adventure games, the tradition has gone from Crowther to Woods
to Zork to Unkuulia to John's Fire Witch, on and on, each game
becoming more and more of a gridlike Dungeons-and-Dragons
"underground environment," with connected rooms full of fantasy
adventure.<br />
Going back to the original can reveal paths not taken, even if
those paths don't lead to anything much.</p>
<p>I have caved but I don't do that anymore.&nbsp; If you are a
wimp, read caving books, such as Brucker &amp; Watson's <i>The
Longest Cave</i>, and Herb &amp; Jan Conn's <i>Jewel Cave
Adventure</i>.&nbsp; You may find you want to write an
old-fashioned cave game after all.</p>

<p>Just a quick footnote: I don't believe anybody here has ever

whether we know accurately which parts are Woods' and which are
Crowther's, but we have quotes attributed to Crowther that he was
playing D&amp;D before he wrote Adventure and was trying to capture
the feeling of playing D&amp;D when he wrote it; thus it seems
questionable to attribute the Tolkein to Woods, although although I
do not disagree with your primary point (which was Zarf's implicit
point as well, I think) that the weird twists and turns of
Adventure's caves are realistic and that realism can be attributed
to Crowther's caving experiences.</p>

<p>Actually that may attribute for most IF games up through the
INFOCOM games.</p>
<p>They all seemed to have aspects of exploration and role playing
combined. Slowly variations came... and then wild changes like
"Nord and Bert Couldn't Make Heads or Tails of it".</p>
<p>Ever since IF has gotten into more writers hands (such as the
annual competition) have we seen more branching of style (the
extreme being "freefall", and other z-machine abuses.)</p>
<p>Games like Phototopia that have raised both positive praise as
art and comments like "that's not a REAL text adventure".</p>
<p>It makes one take pause and ask yourself again "what is a text
adventure?".&nbsp; I feel that the term Interactive Fiction is
certainly more appropriate to encompass what I hope will be a
ever-expanding range of style.</p>
<p>If anyone remembers their first "choose your own adventure" book
and the feeling of "wow, how different", remember that the same can
and will be achieved again and again in IF.</p>

<p>True - but I think we can make some very good guesses,
actually.<br />
We know two facts:</p>
<ol>

<li>

<p>Crowther began the game and Woods added onto it. This puts the
earliest portions of the game (the forest, grate, crawl and dome)
safely in Crowther territory. I have never heard that the two
worked together &ndash; Crowther was at BBN in Boston and Woods at SAIL
in Palo Alto, and Woods got the sources off of ARPANet.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Crowther actually explored the real Colossal/Bedquilt cave.
(Colossal Cave and Bedquilt Cave were found to be connected in
1896.) Parts that match that would be his work. This would mean
everything on the "main line" at least up to Bedquilt itself,
including the Twopit room, Slab Room, Complex Junction, and Y2.
(Probably the main hall with the stone staircase is an
addition...)</p>

<p>An article about Colossal Cave and ADVENT:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href=
"http://web.archive.org/web/20001202181400/http://people.delphi.com/rickadams/adventure/b_cave.html">http://people.delphi.com/rickadams/adventure/b_cave.html</a><br />

quotes Flint Ridge caver Mel Parks as saying:</p>

<div class="msgquote"><p>Bedquilt was Willie's favorite part of the
cave system.</p>
<p>I still have a copy of his map of it.&nbsp; Computer types who grew
up exploring ADVENTURE don't realize how accurately the game
represents passages in Bedquilt Cave.<br />
Yes, there is a Hall of the Mountain King and a Two-Pit Room.<br />
The entrance is indeed a strong steel grate at the bottom of a
twenty-foot depression.<br />
On a survey trip to Bedquilt, a member of my party mentioned she
would one day like to go on a trip to Colossal Cave, where she
understood the game ADVENTURE was set.<br />
No, I said, the game is based on Bedquilt Cave and we are going
there now. Excitement!</p>
<p>
Throughout the cave, she kept up a constant narrative, based on her
encyclopedic knowledge of the game. In the Complex Room (renamed
Swiss Cheese Room in Advent) she scrambled off in a direction I had
never been.</p>
<p>"I just had to see Witt's End," she said upon returning. "It was
exactly as I expected."<br />
When we finished with our work, I let her lead out, which she did
flawlessly, again because she had memorized every move in the game.
Believe me, the cave is a real maze, and this was an impressive
accomplishment for a first-time visitor.</p></div>

</li>

</ol>
<p>Making that trip myself is one my lifetime goals! Maybe someday
I'll be able to tell you which rooms are really in
Colossal/Bedquilt (and thus Crowther's work) and which are
invention. To be honest, the areas of that game have, to me, a very
different feel to them. While some of the magic may be Crowther's
(the game started out as a D&amp;D analogue, as you point out), I
think most of the really un-cavey stuff (the Troll Bridge, chained

<p>Just a quick footnote: I don't believe anybody here has ever

whether we know accurately which parts are Woods' and which are
Crowther's, but we have quotes attributed to Crowther that he was
playing D&amp;D before he wrote Adventure and was trying to capture
the feeling of playing D&amp;D when he wrote it; thus it seems
questionable to attribute the Tolkein to Woods, although although I
do not disagree with your primary point (which was Zarf's implicit
point as well, I think) that the weird twists and turns of
Adventure's caves are realistic and that realism can be attributed
to Crowther's caving experiences.</p>

</div>
<p>I think that the quotation refers to the player-author
interaction more than any of the content. Crowther was reportedly
(according to Adams?) trying to use the D&amp;D-like medium to
convey an accurate representation of the experience of caving.
Presumably, his first version just involved exploring the cave, and
all of the stuff in there and puzzles were added later, when the
medium turned out to be good for that.</p>

<p>Heh...Oh, great.&nbsp; Now you've gone and inspired me to
collect my friends and check out the New York area caves some
weekend.<br />
Just when I was getting used to my sedentary lifestyle,
too...<br />
I guess I'll ask, being vaguely on the topic:&nbsp; Anybody from
the general NY area have any pointers?&nbsp; I believe there's a
set of nice caverns in northern Jersey and southwestern New York,
but I'm not entirely sure where.</p>

<p>For those of you in California, there are a number of caves in
Calivaras County that have both "wuss" and adventure tours.&nbsp;
(California Caverns and Moaning Cavern being a couple I've been
to.)</p>
<p>To do a 150' rappel (about 100 free feet) into the vertical
Moaning cavern (fun, especially if you fear heights, like me :)
followed by an hour or so of hard muddy crawling was $100.</p>
<p>California Cavern had many more beautiful formations, and the
adventure tour was longer, and involved rafting an underground
lake.</p>
<p>Adventure tours are expensive, so you might actually like to get
involved with a local caving organization (a "grotto") and go with
them to some of the more wild caves.&nbsp; On the plus side, the
adventure tours allow you to get a taste of what it's like before
you purchase hundreds of dollars worth of caving equipment.</p>
<p>In Northern California, you can hit the improved Lake Shasta
Caverns. Or in southern Oregon, Oregon Caves.</p>
<p>I love limestone caves, but I love lava tubes just as
well.&nbsp; There are a couple near Mount Lassen in Northern
California, and there are a slew of them at Lava Beds National
Monument in California about 15 miles south of the Oregon
border.&nbsp; While these lack the colorful beauty of (many)
limestone caves, they are neat in their own way.&nbsp; One cave at
Lava Beds, Catacombs, measures over 6000' in length and was for
many years the longest known single entrance cave in
California.&nbsp; Another set of tubes, known as Labyrinth Loop,
provides a great twisty passages all alike experience.</p>
<p>So that you correctly know what kind of a Lava Beds freak I am,
check out these pix:</p>

<p>&nbsp;Mmmm, caves. Interesting environments, though remarkably
creepy. I'm not usually particularly claustrophobic, but I've found
some caves to be very much Fear-Inducing. Particularly the lava
tubes in northeastern California. Those are quite strange, since
they're quite round in cross-section, conveniently sized for a
human (or a Cyberman or a horrible drooling monster!) to walk
through comfortably, and twist and turn in strange snake-like
mazes. They form when liquid lava flows crust overtop, resulting in
subterranean rivers of molten rock. The lava eventually drains out,
leaving an empty cave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I took a bunch of photos in a couple of those caves for
possible use in my Giant Game Currently on Hiatus, and found myself
constantly looking nervously over my shoulder. Along with my
cameras and flash I think I brought about five flashlights and a
cigarette lighter with me. Another lava tube I've photographed, on
Hawaii's big island, is the cave entrance I used for the HTML TADS
version of the Golden Skull demo game. This is a much shorter tube
- you can almost see straight from one end to the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Probably the coolest caves I've been in were in New
Zealand. I've been in Oregon's limestone caves and coastal sea
cave, France's Gouffre de Padirac and England's Wookey Hole, but
they're all touristy caves with staircases and lamps and guided
tours. (hell - the sealion cave has an elevator!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;New Zealand has some caves like that, but also some less
domesticated ones. I rappelled into one huge cave called the Lost
World - one of the highlights of my trip there last year. It's
basically a giant hole in the ground, and you rappel (abseil) down
a 100 metre (300 foot) rope to get into it. It's like descending
into a massive cylinder in the ground, open to the sky, lined with
lush plantlife. This cave is shown briefly during the black and
white sequence in Vincent Ward's NZ-made fantasy film The
Navigator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;New Zealand also has an interesting species of fly which
spend their larval phases in caves and similar environments. The
larvae hang from the roofs of caves and spin little sticky strings
which dangle down. The particularly interesting bit is that their
asses glow blue-green in order to attract prey to the sticky
strings. So when you're inside one of these caves and you look up
at the ceiling you'll see a beautiful constellation of tiny blue
stars overhead - the glowing glowworms, as they're called. Amazing.
Not exactly glowing fungus providing enough light for a
subterranean topiary, but nonetheless really cool.</p>

<p>Caves are the original IF setting; caves are also darn
cool.<br />
I've written an IF game set in a cave (<i>Hunter, in
Darkness</i>).<br />
But I didn't actually have much idea what caves were like, when I
wrote it. Most of my description was second-hand Crowther and
Woods. So, hey, I thought, I should see good movie footage of real
caves.<br />
&lt;SNIP&gt;<br />
Observation is good. If you want to write about caves, go look in
one. If you're actually an adventurer, and not a wimp like me, go
caving. Report back. We're curious what it's like beyond the
handrails.<br /></p>

<p>Sometimes it's easier to create a realistic seeming simulation
of an unfamiliar thing if you build it with the type of shared
preconception and good imagination you must have used to make
Hunter. Another classic example of this technique succeeding (as I
think Hunter did) is Rodgers and Hammerstein's "The King and I",
which many people believe sounds very eastern, but about which
Rodgers admitted he did no research: he just wrote music he thought
sounded eastern.</p>

<p>There are alternatives, if you're half a wimp.&nbsp; ^_^</p>
<p>When I went to Carlsbad a few years ago, a friend and I embarked
on one of their "Wild Cave" tours.&nbsp; That is, you're still
guided by a park ranger, but you get to go off the main paved
walkways and go crawling, climbing, and scrambling in the more
natural parts of the caves.&nbsp; At one point, we found ourselves
in a pit looking up at one of the paved trails on the self-guided
walking tour, which we'd just been on the day before.&nbsp; From
the railing, looking down into darkness, we wouldn't have guessed
that a group of people might be looking back up at us!</p>
<p>Highly recommended, and I know other developed caves offer
similar deals.</p>
<p>In three weeks I'm going backpacking at Mammoth Cave National
Park.&nbsp; I think the last day we're supposed to go on a cave
tour.&nbsp; Yeah, the walking kind, though I'm going to petition
that we go on the Wild Cave tour instead (I doubt we'll have time
though).&nbsp; I'm tempted to bring along my palmtop loaded with
Adventure, as someone suggested earlier, even if Adventure is
really based on Bedquilt.</p>
